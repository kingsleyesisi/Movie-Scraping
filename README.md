# Web Scraping with Python Code 
# Scraping latest movie 

This code is for the Scraping latest movies with Python

If you're looking for latest movies then this is what you need.

Most code for the second edition is contained in Jupyter notebooks. Although these files can be viewed directly in your browser in Github, some formatting changes and oddities may occur. 

I recommend that you clone the repository, 

install Jupyter, and view them locally for the best experience.

The web changes, libraries update, and make mistakes and typos more frequently than I'd like to admit! If you think you've spotted an error, please feel free to make a pull request against this repository.
